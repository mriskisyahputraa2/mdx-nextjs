Welcome back to my blog! In this post, I will share some thoughts on how to enhance your web development workflow.

## The Power of Clean Code

Writing clean, maintainable code is a fundamental aspect of web development. Here are a few tips to help you achieve that:

- **Consistency is Key**: Stick to a style guide and maintain consistent naming conventions.
- **Keep it Simple**: Avoid overcomplicating your code with unnecessary logic.
- **Refactor Regularly**: Regularly review and refactor your code to keep it efficient.

### Code Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to structure a simple React component with clean code:

```jsx
import React from "react";

const Greeting = ({ name }) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
};

export default Greeting;
```
